### Approach taken

1. We started by drawing out our Wireframes to a diagram and to plan our project.
2. After that, we made a planning board and wrote user stories using Trello.
3. We created models, views, and controllers for our app. We achieved full CRUD using RESTful routing.
4. Lastly, after all the debugging, we deployed the project to Heroku.


### Future Implementations

* The ability to create a meal plan for weight loss
* The ability to have autocomplete function for the search bar
* The ability for users being able to upload a before and after picture
* The ability to have the meal history of the user to be displayed in a calendar
